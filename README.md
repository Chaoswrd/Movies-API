<h1 align="center">Movies-API</h1>
<p align="center"> This project displays some of the possibilites with Java Spring Boot, Postgresql and Docker</p>

<h2 align="left">Description</h2>
<p align="left">
Movies-API uses Java Spring Boot as a REST-API to be able to retrieve information from a Postgresql database. Both the REST-API and the database are hosted with help from Docker. Docker ensures that the project should be able to run on any system that has the capability to run the Docker daemon.</p>

<p align="left">
The dataset used for this project was retrieved from [9000+ Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/disham993/9000-movies-dataset) and was created by Doula Isham Rashik Hasan. The dataset has been transformed from the original with the help of Informatica PowerCenter. The original dataset has a "genre" column that included multiple comma-separated values. The genres has been normalised into a separate table and they have a many to many relationship with movies.
